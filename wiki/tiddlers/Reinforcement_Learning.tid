!! Theorems

<<<
''Theorem'' [Value iteration converges]<br>
At convergence, we have found the optimal value function $V^*$ for the discounted infinite horizon problem, which satisfies the Bellman equations
$$
\forall S\in S:\qquad V^*(s) = \max_a\sum_{s'}P(s'|s, a)[R(s, a, s')+\gamma V^*(s')]
$$

''Temporal Difference Learning:'' Policy evaluation for the current policy $\pi_k$
$$
V^{\pi_k}_{i+1}(s) \leftarrow \sum_{s'}P(s'|s, \pi_k(s))[R(s, \pi_k(s), s')+\gamma V^{\pi_k}_{i}(s')]
$$
Policy improvements: find the best action according to one-step look-ahead
$$
\pi_{k+1}(s) \leftarrow \arg\max_a\sum_{s'}P(s'|s, a)[R(s, a, s')+\gamma V^{\pi_k}(s')]
$$

<<<
''Theorem'' [Policy iteration converges]<br>
Policy iteration is guaranteed to converge and at convergence, the current policy and its value function ar the optimal policy and the optimal value function.

We sample states $\epsilon$-greedily.

!! RL agents
* value based, has a value function where policy can be inferred.
* policy based, work in decision space, more direct. Policy Graident.
* [[Actor-Critic Method]]: stores policy and value
* model free/based

!! Anatomy of a RL algorithm
Iterate these 3 steps：

# Generate samples (i.e. run the policy)
# Fit a model to estimate return
#* MC policy gradient: compute $\hat Q = \sum_{t'=t}^T\gamma^{t'-t}r_{t'}$
#* [[Actor-Critic Method]], [[Q-Learning]]: fit $Q_\phi(s, a)$
#* Model-based: estimate $p(s'|s, a)$
# Improve the policy
#* [[Policy Gradient]]: $\theta\leftarrow\theta+\alpha\nabla_\theta J(\theta)$
#* Q-learning: $\pi(s) = \arg\max Q_\phi(s, a)$
#* Model-based: optimize $\pi_\theta(a|s)$

!! Tricks

* Freezing target network
* Error clipping, reward clipping
* Experience replay

!! Training steps
On training half-cheetah, each one is 10x easier than previous. (each episodes is 1000 steps)

* gradient-free methods, e.g. evolution strategies, CMA, etc. 
* fully online methods, e.g. A3C, 100,000 episodes ~15 days
* policy gradient methods, e.g. TRPO, 10,000 episodes
* relay buffer value estimation, e.g. Q-learning, DDPG, NAF, etc., 1,000 episodes
* model-based deep RL, e.g. guided policy search
* model-based shallow RL, e.g. PILCO
