Neural networks (esp. softmax regressions) are easily fooled. We can add noise-like filters to attack a neural net, misleading it to wrong prediction while making no perceptional difference to human. For example, we can perform gradient ascent on the input to change its prediction.

! Explaining the Weakness
First guess is the model is overfitted. Rather than randomly misclassification, there is a systematic behavior. 

This can be explained better, if we imagine the decision surface being far too linear, rather than too complex. Actually, modern deep nets are indeed very piecewise linear. By moving the input along the adversarial direction, images always tend to be mistaken as another fixed class, defending this linear assumption.

Deep neural nets cannot make intentional decisions like human, they learn in a wrong way. They don't learn the contour of the input space, but just some general directions. Adversarial examples unveil its limitations.

J(x, \theta)+(\tilde x-x)^\top\nabla_xJ(x)

subject to
$$
\|\tilde x-x\|_\infty \le \epsilon
