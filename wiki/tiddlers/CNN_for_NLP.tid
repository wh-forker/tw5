First read this post [[Understanding CNN for NLP|http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/]]

And this course： [[Stanford CNN for NLP]]

[[A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences]]: A good paper to read. The model is kind of too complex.

[[Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification]]: A one-layer CNN approach with simplicity and empirical performance. This has become the standard baseline for new text classification publications.
